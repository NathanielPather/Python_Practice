# Python Practice

This is a project where I practice python.

I am also using the pycodestyle library to practice using the pep8 coding standard.

## Hello World
### Explanation
Simple introduction to installing all the necessary tools.

### Learning outcomes

* Learned to leave a new line character at the end of file.

## Hello Variable
### Explanation

Same as hello world but with the introduction of variables.

### Learning outcomes

* Learned print(f) is short hand for print(.format())
* Learned to use space between '#' and comment text

## Input
### Explanation

Same as hello world but using input variables.

### Learning outcomes

* Nothing significant

## GST_Tax
### Explanation

Calculates the gst tax for a given meal.

### Learning outcomes

* Learned casting input string to other types.
* Learned number formatting to 2 decimal places.

## Fizzbuzz
### Explanation

Fizzbuzz implementation in python

### Learning outcomes

* White space before '()', ':' not allowed

## QR_Creator
### Explanation

Generates qr code images from input links

### Learning outcomes

* Nothing significant

## Data_Visualizer
### Explanation

Introduction to plotly library usage for data visualization projects

### Learning outcomes

* Nothing significant

## Flower_Prediction
### Explanation

Introduction to machine learning. Uses data sets containing measurements of flowers to predict the species of flowers.

Overall I've learned quite a bit on the general process, but more projects need to be completed for proficiency.

### Learning outcomes

* Learned a very general process for implementing machine learning for prediction.
* Importing data sets. Kaggle is a good source.
* Data Visualizations. Good for getting a quick idea of what the data means.
* Data can be plotted as either univariate (single attribute) or multivariate (relationships between attributes).
* Creating a validation data set. Validation dataset tells us how good our prediction model is.
* Creating a training data set. Training dataset trains the models.
* Creating an evaluation data set. Evaluation dataset is analysed by the model and predictions are made.
* Build models using multiple algorithms.
* Select the most accurate model.
* Provide the model the training data.
* Complete the predictions and evaluate them to the validation data set.

## Win_Prediction
### Explanation

An attempt to implement the same machine learning program on predicting wins for league of legends matches based on match data.

Wwhile the accuracy states 82%, I have very little experience and the model may not be accurate at all.

### Learning outcomes

* Learned a few more specifics and filling in the gaps in my knowledge.
* Array slicing is needed to split training, evaluation, and validation data from each other.
* From my understanding, the X array contains the input variables.
* The Y array contains the output variables.
* Input variables are what you put in.
* Output variables are what you hope to predict and may be missing in some cases.
* I think I'll begin to look at the algorithms more in depth.
